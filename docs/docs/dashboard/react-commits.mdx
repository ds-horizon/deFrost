The scatter plot overlays React commit events on the bar graph, providing insights into how React updates affect frame rendering performance.

### Features

- **Scatter Points:**  
   When you hover over scatter points on the graph, you will see labels like this:  
   <img src={reactCommitLabels} alt="React commit labels" />  

   These labels display the names of components where state changes occurred in React Native. The state changes signify the starting point of a re-render. All these state changes happen between the previous and next frames in Android. Clicking on a scatter point will open a detailed pop-up.

- **Pop-Up:**  
   <div style={{display: 'flex', alignItems: 'start', gap: '16px'}}>
      <img src={popup} alt="Pop-up example" style={{height: '300px'}} />  
      <div>
        <p>A pop-up appears as shown on the left. This pop-up provides detailed information, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Component Name</b>: The name of the component where the state change originated, initiating the re-render.</li>
          <li><b>List of Affected Components</b>: A list of child components impacted by the state change in the originating component.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
   </div>

:::note
Scatter points help identify React updates that contribute to high frame rendering times.
