## Identifying Performance Problems with De-frost

Follow these steps to detect bottlenecks using the De-frost dashboard:

1. **Analyze the Bar Graph:**
   - Locate frames where total rendering time crosses the **red threshold (700ms)**.
   - Identify which segments (e.g., layout or animation) consume the most time.

2. **Examine React Commit Scatter Points:**
   - Look for scatter points overlapping with frozen frames.
   - Identify React components responsible for the delays.

3. **Inspect the Pop-Up Details:**
   - Click scatter points to reveal the affected components.
   - Use this data to trace React updates causing performance degradation.

4. **Take Action:**
   - Optimize React components or rendering pipeline stages contributing to frozen frames.
   - Repeat the process after changes to measure improvements.

This structure creates a clear separation between the **overview**, **bar graph**, **React Native commits**, and the actionable **problem identification**. Each document uses Docusaurus components to enhance readability and interactivity.
