The npm package `@d11/defrost` helps you **detect and analyze frozen frames** in mobile applications by combining data extraction and visualization.

### Step 1: Prepare the APK

Generate an APK with embedded tracking for React commit data using:

```sh
yarn de-frost create-build -f <flavor> -v <variant>
```

**Flags:**
- `-f`: Specifies the APK flavor (e.g., `staging`, `prod`).
- `-v`: Specifies the APK variant (e.g., `debug`, `release`).

The modified APK is saved in the `ff-build` folder of your project.

> **Why?** React commit data correlates UI updates with frame rendering, offering insights into frozen frames.

---

### Step 2: Install the APK and Connect via ADB

1. Install the modified APK on your Android device.
2. Grant **Files and Media permissions** for logging.
3. Connect the device to your computer using **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)**.

> **Why?** These steps enable your app to capture and transfer performance data for analysis.

---

### Step 3: Record Frame and React Commit Data

Capture data with:

```sh
yarn de-frost record -p <package-name>
```

**Flags:**
- `-p`: The package name of your app (e.g., `com.example.myapp`).

This command:
- Records **frame rendering data**, showing timings for each rendering stage.
- Captures **React commit data**, linking component updates to frames.

The data is saved in a `data` folder in CSV format.

> **Why?** This step generates raw data to analyze bottlenecks, frozen frames, and React updates.

---

### Step 4: Visualize the Data

Launch the dashboard with:

```sh
yarn de-frost show-dashboard -d <data-folder-location>
```

**Flags:**
- `-d`: Specifies the directory containing the data (default: `data` folder).

The dashboard features:
- **Bar graphs** of frame rendering times, segmented by pipeline stages.
- **Scatter plots** of React commits, correlating them with frames.
- **Interactive details** for frames and React commit events.

> **Why?** The visualization makes it easier to identify trends, frozen frames, and performance issues.

---

### Summary Workflow

1. Create an APK with tracking enabled:
   ```sh
   yarn de-frost create-build -f <flavor> -v <variant>
   ```
2. Install the APK, connect via ADB, and start the app.
3. Record frame and React commit data:
   ```sh
   yarn de-frost record -p <package-name>
   ```
4. Visualize the data:
   ```sh
   yarn de-frost show-dashboard -d <data-folder-location>
   ```

By following these steps, you can effectively **detect frozen frames**, pinpoint their root causes, and optimize your app's performance.
